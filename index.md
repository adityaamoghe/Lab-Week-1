# Welcome to Aditya's Webpage

Hi! Welcome to my **Webpage**. Take a look into my life as a *programmer* and as a *person*! Here's an inspirational quote from Einstein himself:

> Imagination is more important than knowledge. For
> knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire
> world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); 
    }
}
